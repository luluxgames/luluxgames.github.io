                <h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>
                <p>My name is <strong>LucÃ­a Puga</strong>, I am from GavÃ  and I was born in 2001. As a graduate in Stage <strong>Direction and Dramaturgy</strong> at ESAD (Institut del Teatre), I have worked mainly in the field of <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>character creation</strong>; specializing in <strong>audiovisual script</strong> and <strong>video game narratives</strong> through my TFG (in collaboration with <strong>UCM</strong>). During my university career I have written scripts focused on audiovisual, even for the radio field. Also, doing narrative mentoring for a video game currently in development for <strong>Virtual Reality</strong>.</p>
                <p>But, outside of my academic career, I have learned thanks to great professionals to communicate through <strong>copywriting</strong> and <strong>social networks</strong>, making use of my knowledge of <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>graphic design</strong> learned self-taught. I also try to use my creative taste to model in 3D the characters in my scripts.</p>
                <p>My goal is to focus my career and professional growth in the <strong>field of video games</strong>, using all the tools that my specialization in <strong>Script</strong> has given me and learning new ones. At the moment I am expanding my academic career by learning <strong>programming and video game development</strong> at the ENTI (School of New Interactive Technologies); where I am acquiring more experience in <strong>game design</strong>, with which I already had contact during my TFG.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm in the <strong>GameBCN</strong> pre-incubator working hand in hand with the <strong>A Tiny Eternity</strong> team.</p>
