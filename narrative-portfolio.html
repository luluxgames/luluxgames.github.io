        <h2>LEFTOVER - Fantastic Animation</h2>
        <p>In a grey, desolate village, lives Yago, a shy nine-year-old boy facing personal and social struggles. His only comfort is his companion Leftover — a creature built from scrap and remnants of sea animals, created by his scientist parents to help him cope with loneliness.</p>
        <p>This story addresses childhood autism and the difficulties it entails.</p>

        <h2>El Chico Trizas – Fantastic Realism</h2>
        <p>An adaptation inspired by Sarah Kane’s <em>4.48 Psychosis</em>. I reshaped the text into a new dramatic form, influenced by the real experience of someone going through a psychotic episode. The result: a raw, urban-inspired narrative with street-like characters.</p>
