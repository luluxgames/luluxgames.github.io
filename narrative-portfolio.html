		  <h2>>> Introduction to Video Game Narratives - <em>Final Degree Project</em></h2>
		  
		  <p>
			My TFG focuses on video game narrative, exploring from its theoretical foundations to its practical 
			application in pedagogical contexts. This research seeks to generate an introductory contextual and 
			theoretical framework on the narrative bases of video games. Thus, through its history, context and 
			form, video game narrative is a dramatic field that is still expanding and of great artistic interest. 
			What are the bases on which the future of narrative is governed?
		  </p>

		  <p>
			This research work is born from the need to understand and shed light on the bases on which it is 
			governed and its theoretical context, with the main objective of approaching a possible methodology 
			for video game analysis and creation.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			I develop the main concepts of the MDA Framework (Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics) and its impact 
			on the creation of interactive stories. I explore the similarities between traditional dramaturgy and 
			video game narrative, highlighting how both fields share narrative structures and character development.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			The case study of the main study is the <strong>Didascalia V.C.</strong> project in collaboration with 
			the UCM, which applies VR in education, demonstrating the effectiveness of interactive narrative in 
			pedagogical contexts. In this project, I was able to mentor the development team in relation to the 
			creation of narratives, presenting a possible structure applicable to the final version of the video game.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			The conclusions highlight how technology can foster creative innovation and the importance of narrative 
			in video games to offer personalized experiences to players. I achieved a final grade of <strong>9.5</strong>.

		  <p>In a vibrant world where music is power and rhythm rules all, a young rebel steps onto the stage.
		  Armed with a sharp tongue, killer dance moves, and an unshakable sense of style, they take on eccentric
		  rivals in rhythm-based battles. Each opponent brings their own musical genre to the fight
		  — from synthwave vampires to punk rock werewolves — turning every duel into a high-energy showdown
		  packed with beats, banter, and musical mayhem.</p>

            In the heart of a gray and desolate village, lives a boy named Yago. He is a shy nine-year-old boy, 
            who faces difficulties at school and in his daily life due to personal and social problems. 
            In the midst of his loneliness, he finds solace in the presence of his pet, his eternal companion 
            Leftover, a creature built from scrap metal, fragments and limbs of other sea animals.

            The story is about Steve, a human astronaut who travels through the universe and visits different 
            worlds (one for each episode). During each short film, the protagonist will encounter different 
            creatures and eccentric situations that test his way of seeing the world. However, he will also 
            encounter a recurring setback: his left arm spontaneously throws a wafer at his own face.

            My knowledge of adaptation led me to create a play based on Sarah Kane's "Psychosis of 4.48". 
            In this project, in addition to analyzing and rewriting the original text to give it a completely 
            new form, I started from the real experience of an acquaintance who had recently gone through a 
            psychotic break. One of the main objectives of my staging was to portray a raw and difficult 
            reality, full of urban references and street characters.

          <p>
            Another of my staging projects is based on the work of “Tres Mujeres” by Sylvia Plath. 
            In the adaptation that I attach below, from the original text I was able to define and create a 
            scenography and a narrative design that goes beyond the author's proposal; in addition to carrying 
            out an exhaustive analysis of the characters and the environment based on personal intuitions. 
            In this project I emphasize feminism, the figure of women and the different existing motherhoods.
