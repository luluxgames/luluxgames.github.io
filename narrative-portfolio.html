        <h2>>> LEFTOVER - <em>Fantastic Animation</em></h2>
        <p>In the heart of a gray and desolate village, lives a boy named Yago. He is a shy nine-year-old boy, who faces difficulties at school and in his daily life due to personal and social problems. In the midst of his loneliness, he finds solace in the presence of his pet, his eternal companion Leftover, a creature built from scrap metal, fragments and limbs of other sea animals.
The creators are his own scientific parents, who create the animal with the aim of improving their son's emotional situation. Despite the struggles he faces, Yago forms a deep and special bond with Leftover, his only source of affection and comfort that he accepts in a world that seems full of difficulties.</p>
        <p>This is a story that talks about autism during childhood and the difficulties it entails:</p>

        <h2>>> Across the Cosmos - <em>Comedy & Adventure Miniseries</em></h2>
        <p>The story is about Steve, a human astronaut who travels through the universe and visits different worlds (one for each episode). During each short film, the protagonist will encounter different creatures, situations and spaces that test his way of seeing the world. These eccentric situations are always solved thanks to the ingenuity and spontaneity of our astronaut. However, the protagonist will encounter a small setback in absolutely all of his adventures: his left arm, spontaneously and without warning, will occasionally throw a wafer at his own face.</p>

        <h2>>> El Chico Trizas – <em>Fantastic Realism</em></h2>
        <p>My knowledge of adaptation led me to create a play based on Sarah Kane's "Psychosis
of 4.48". In this project, in addition to analyzing and rewriting the original text to give it a completely new form, I started from the real experience of an acquaintance who had recently gone through a psychotic break. One of the main objectives of my staging was to portray a raw and difficult reality, which is full of urban references
and street characters.</p>

<p>Below, I leave you the direct link to the project:</p>

        <h2>>> Tres Mujeres – <em>Feminist Poetry</em></h2>
        <p>Another of my staging projects is based on the work of “Tres Mujeres” by Sylvia Plath. In the adaptation that I attach below, from the original text I was able to define and create a scenography and a narrative design that goes beyond the author's proposal; in addition to carrying out an exhaustive analysis of the characters and the environment based on personal intuitions. In this project I emphasize feminism, the figure of women and the different existing motherhoods.
